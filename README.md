It is time to make your machines more faster,
Process everythings as quick as possible.

According to your modpack you should change all the crafts recipes (because default crafts are OPAF).
Everything begin with Mass anvil that can make PCB, PCB are required for all machines recipes.

Machine block is the everything machine, you can do lots of things with this single machine, append an engine, and a focus.

## Focus 
- Smelter focus make the machine block like a furnace
- Grinder focus you can crush ores into dusts
- Alloy focus you can make alloy (like steel)
- Compresion / Decompresion to make blocks into ingots, ingots to nuggets ... you know what i mean
- Plate focus
- Gear focus
- Transposer focus (work in progress)
- Recycler focus, to get back crafted tools into ingots (like diamond chestplate -> 8 diamonds) (wip)
 PCB focus, because mass anvil is boring sometime
- Extraction focus, put ores and get blocks.
- ...

## Engines

- Water Lava engine is the Tier 1 , you can make power for your machine or cobble (depend of the machine utilitie)- Ender engine (Tier 2) usefull as power provider or Aging gun.
- Wither engine (Tier 3) for more power or to craft tier 4 engine.
- Mega engine (Tier 4)
- Ultimate engine (Tier 5) is the best engine for machines

## Machines

- The 2 modules machine is in my opinion the most usefull machine for automation, you can put 2 focus in there like
(grinder focus and smelter focus) or (extraction focus and decompresion focus).
- Uncrafting table is there to uncraft everything (9 experience cost per uncraft).
- Stack furnace is the most powerfull machine, he smelt things stack by stack.
- Cobble form is a cobble, sand, gravel, stone and glass generator.
- Tree farmer can grows up everything (from minecraft vanilla).
- Aging gun can turn block into an other block (like ice into packed ice, netherrack into lava, ...)
- Dimensional hole (Dhole) is still in developement.


The input of all machine is made by the top (blue arrows) and the automatic output by the bottom (orange arrows) but you can extract by the sides.

## about 

This mod is still in developement (like my english :p)

JEI integration is implemented.
